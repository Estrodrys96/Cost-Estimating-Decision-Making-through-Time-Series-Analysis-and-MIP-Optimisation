Solver Setup Instructions:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Set Objective: B14 to Min,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. By Changing Variable Cells: G4:G11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Add Constraints:,,"ALSO, let G4:G11 be binary as a constraint in Solver.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Select Solving Method: Simplex LP (or GRG Nonlinear if binary constraint causes issues, though Simplex usually handles binary fine if formulated as integer)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ensure ""Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative"" is unchecked if allowing costs to be negative (not applicable here, but good practice).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
